⏺ Perfect! You've clarified the internal workflow - this is much clearer now. Let me update the understanding:

  ✅ Corrected Workflow (Internal Team Only)

  ClothingCo e-commerce (http://localhost:5174/) = External production app with bug
  - End users shop, checkout, see wrong totals
  - They DON'T create tickets
  - They might complain via support/email

  Jerai Bug Tracker (http://localhost:5173/) = Internal tool for engineering team
  - Internal engineers monitor issues, user complaints, logs
  - Internal engineer creates ticket: "Cart total wrong, $107.76 instead of $107.77"
  - Internal engineer clicks "Activate" → moves to ACTIVE
  - Internal engineer clicks "AI Fix" → triggers automated pipeline
  - System auto-transitions RESOLVED → CLOSED if tests pass
  - Internal engineer reviews Events tab to see patch, apply it

  Architecture Flow:

  1. Internal Engineer creates ticket in Jerai
     ↓
  2. Internal Engineer clicks "Activate" (NEW → ACTIVE)
     ↓
  3. Internal Engineer clicks "AI Fix"
     ↓
  4. Backend Pipeline:
     - Cerebras API: Fast bug analysis (what's wrong, likely cause)
     - MCP Agent: Read buggy code from backend/ecommerce/cart.py
     - Llama 3.3 70B: Generate patch (float → Decimal)
     - Run tests: pytest backend/tests/test_cart.py
     - Log events: analysis, patch diff, test results
     ↓
  5. Auto-transition:
     - Tests pass → ACTIVE → RESOLVED → CLOSED
     - Tests fail → stay in ACTIVE with error events
     ↓
  6. Internal Engineer reviews:
     - Events tab shows: analysis, patch, test logs
     - Download/apply patch manually

  Should I proceed building the backend with this corrected understanding?
